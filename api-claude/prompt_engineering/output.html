                <td class="reasoning">The solution fully satisfies all mandatory requirements by providing daily caloric total, macronutrient breakdown, and meals with exact foods, portions, and timing. It also comprehensively meets all secondary criteria: high carbohydrate meals throughout the day, pre-workout meal before 6:30 AM training, complete dairy exclusion, and full day coverage. The only minor issue is a mathematical discrepancy in the macro calculations, but this is a quality concern rather than a violation of stated requirements.</td>

                <td class="reasoning">The solution meets all mandatory requirements by including daily caloric total, macronutrient breakdown, and meals with exact foods, portions, and timing. It successfully excludes dairy and provides meal timing across the day. The caloric total of 2,220 kcal is within the acceptable range (±100). However, the macronutrient distribution significantly deviates from the specified targets, particularly for protein and carbohydrates, which exceed their targets by substantial margins. While the criteria specify 'approximately 200g (±10g)' for protein, the 253g delivered is well outside this range. This represents a significant deficiency in meeting the secondary criteria.</td>
