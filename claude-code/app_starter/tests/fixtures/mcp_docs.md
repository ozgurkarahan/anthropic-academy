Overview

The Model Context Protocol allows applications to provide context for LLMs in a standardized
way, separating the concerns of providing context from the actual LLM interaction.

Key Features of this Python SDK

●  Build MCP clients that can connect to any MCP server
●  Create MCP servers that expose resources, prompts, and tools
●  Use standard transports like stdio and SSE
●  Handle all MCP protocol messages and lifecycle events
